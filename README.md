# Steps: The step to run the files in the directories are as follows

Python files
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. training		--> Used to train the model

2. prediction:		--> Used to predict the model

3. InteractivePlot:	--> Used to call the predicted model and visualize the results

4. GmshToTrainData:	--> This file extracts the Gmsh mesh from .msh file, to create training points. (used for those cases where 			    point cloud is used)


Folders
-------------------------------------------------------------
results	-> has the results for each case
